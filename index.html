	<p style="text-align: left;"> Hi! my name is Lindsey Ferguson, I’m a Computer Science Applied Computing major, 
	who is pursuing a Minor in Mathematics, I’m also enrolled in the CO-OP program. You can see my current semesters schedule 
	in the schedule tab! I am currently 19 years old, and I am from Windsor. I have 2 siblings and a dog, I included a couple
	pictures of my dog for reference, his name is Tucker, and he is a yellow Labrador retriever, he is currently two years old. 
	In the first photo you can see his scar, he unfortunately had to get surgery, but he’s ok, and doing well now. My favourite 
	colours include black, royal purple, matcha green, sapphire blue, light blue, and emerald green. My favourite food is cookie 
	dough ice cream or stroopwafels, which you can read more on in my Interest page! I also love travelling (not in the current 
	covid situation though, safety first!) which in the Travel goals tab you can see some of the places I hope to travel to one day!.
	</p>
	
	<!--second paragraph aligned to the center-->
	<p style="text-align: center;"> 
	One of my favourite hobbies includes 3d printing! Where you can make or find 3d models and using different types of materials, 
	most commonly plastics like PLA, TPU, and ABS you can then print out that model layer by layer. For 3d printing you first start 
	off with a 3d model, that you then have to input into a slicer, which breaks down that model layer by layer so then the printer 
	knows how to print it, this then produces a g-code, which in my case I then export onto a USB, and then upload it to my printer,
	then I preheat my printer and insert a filament of my choice, filament refers to your printing material. The most common is PLA 
	(polylactic acid) which is a form of rigid plastic, compared to others like TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) which is more of a 
	soft plastic like silicone, which is more flexible. Then I finally program my printer to print the model, this is the longest part 
	as simple prints take around 1-3 hours to print, the more complicated the longer it takes.
	</p>
	
	<!--third paragraph aligned to the right-->
	<p style="text-align: right;"> 
	My longest 3d print to this date has been 17 hours, in which I 3d printed a Julius Caesar pencil holder. It holds pencils by stab 
	wounds in his back. Some honourable mentions are:  T-Rex skull (10 hours), and a lattice (6 hours). Luckily a lot of 3d models can 
	be found free online, as while modeling and creating your own is fun, it takes a lot of time, patience, and practice if you don’t
	have access to a 3d scanner. For example, I had to try and replicate a part for our washing machine that had broken off, 
	it took a lot of measurements and trial an error as I had to do all the modelling and measurements by hand and since the piece 
	that broke was quite big, it took along time to print, but after 3 different prototypes I finally had it correct.
